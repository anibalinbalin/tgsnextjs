                Our growth depends on generosity. Many of our founding families gave with heart and vision to help us reach this point, and we<span style={{ fontFamily: 'var(--font-geist-sans), system-ui, sans-serif' }}>'</span>ll always be grateful. But to keep going, to keep building, and to keep offering scholarships to students with the potential to change the world, we need others to step in too. If you (or someone you know) believe in the power of education to change a life — or perhaps even a continent — we<span style={{ fontFamily: 'var(--font-geist-sans), system-ui, sans-serif' }}>'</span>d love to hear from you.
