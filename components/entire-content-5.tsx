Learners work with both educators simultaneously on coherent units of inquiry, with project output carefully balanced between English and Spanish depending on the language profile of each individual. This approach favours language acquisition, fosters engagement, and improves student confidence and sense of identity. To model our approach beyond the classroom, every member of our School<span style={{ fontFamily: 'var(--font-geist-sans), system-ui, sans-serif' }}>'</span>s team is fully English-Spanish bilingual.</p>
