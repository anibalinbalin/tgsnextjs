            <p className="text-2xl leading-relaxed font-light text-white">Forest schools show how nature-based education enhances holistic growth. Studies in the UK reveal that children in forest schools demonstrate greater focus, social confidence, and motor coordination (Knight, 2013). Nature-based learning promotes teamwork, resilience, and self-regulation. Academic performance also benefits: forest school students often outperform peers in problem-solving and creative thinking (Gill, 2014).
