Children who play in green spaces demonstrate better motor skills, balance, and agility than those in built environments (Fjørtoft, 2001). Climbing trees, jumping rocks, and balancing on uneven terrain develop physical strength and flexibility. Regular exposure to nature increases physical activity levels and reduces the risk of obesity and related health issues (WHO, 2022). Time outdoors also improves sleep quality and immune function, while natural light exposure helps prevent myopia and supports overall physical development (Straker et al., 2016).</p>
