While no two childhoods are the same, every student needs a trusted network to lean on, especially in moments of challenge. As a diverse and inclusive community welcoming students from Uruguay and beyond, we are committed to providing a secure and nurturing environment where every individual can thrive. Our dedicated Safeguarding Team, led by a Designated Safeguarding Lead and supported by School Leadership, works collaboratively across the school to ensure the well-being of all our students.</p>
