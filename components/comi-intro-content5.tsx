Each committee brings parents, educators, and students to the same table — because student voice matters, and our learners sit on every committee. This collaborative spirit is more than a structure; it<span style={{ fontFamily: 'var(--font-geist-sans), system-ui, sans-serif' }}>'</span>s a culture. By gathering in ways that strengthen bonds and foster shared purpose, we not only pursue excellence inside the classroom but also shape meaningful experiences beyond it, living our mission of empowering changemakers.</p>
