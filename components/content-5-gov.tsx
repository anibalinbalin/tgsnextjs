This model ensures that our school is community-led, mission-driven, and fully reinvests its resources in students, teachers, and the long-term impact of education in Uruguay. In contrast with the for-profit education models common across the region, the Asociación Civil model means there are no shareholders and no external owners. Every decision made and every dollar spent serves a single purpose: to deliver the best possible education for our students and to contribute positively to society.</p>
