Studies show that children with regular access to green spaces demonstrate better working memory and cognitive flexibility (Dadvand et al., 2015). Even a short walk in a park can improve focus and self-control, particularly for children with ADHD (Taylor & Kuo, 2009). Natural environments provide rich, varied stimuli that challenge young minds, encouraging exploration and adaptive thinking. This boost in executive function translates into improved concentration and problem-solving back in the classroom, sharpening the mental tools children need for academic success (Li & Sullivan, 2016).</p>
