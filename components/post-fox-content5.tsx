Research shows that children with regular exposure to green spaces report lower levels of cortisol, the stress hormone (van den Berg et al., 2010). Time spent outdoors reduces symptoms of depression and improves emotional regulation (McCurdy et al., 2010). Being in nature fosters a sense of freedom and peace, helping children build resilience and emotional stability. Studies link green play areas to increased self-esteem and positive social interactions, reinforcing the idea that time in nature supports emotional health and psychological balance (Wells & Evans, 2003).</p>
