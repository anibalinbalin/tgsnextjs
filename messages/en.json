Natural environments provide rich, varied stimuli that challenge young minds, encouraging exploration and adaptive thinking.

Climbing trees, jumping rocks, and balancing on uneven terrain develop physical strength and flexibility. Regular exposure to nature increases physical activity levels and reduces the risk of obesity and related health issues (WHO, 2022).

Academic performance also benefits: forest school students often outperform peers in problem-solving and creative thinking (Gill, 2014). This hands-on, student-led model fosters independent learning and adaptability, equipping children with life skills beyond the classroom. Nature is not just a setting—it's a powerful teacher.

This model is not merely administrative; it reflects a deliberate commitment to transparency, sustainability, and shared ownership. It shapes how decisions are made, how resources are used, and how the school remains accountable to its families, staff, and mission over time."

        "content": "The Asociación Civil exists first and foremost to protect the school's founding vision: a place where students' needs, learning quality, and wellbeing always come before financial interest. As a non-profit entity, TGS can make long-term educational decisions guided by its mission rather than by shareholders or short-term pressures. This ensures that every dollar the school earns or receives is reinvested directly into its people, its programs, and its purpose."
      },
      "transparency": {
        "title": "Promote transparency and accountability",
        "content": "The Asociación Civil model demands openness and shared responsibility. Every major institutional decision, from budget approval to leadership appointments, is overseen by a clear governance framework that is reviewed in annual assemblies and supported by public records. This means that families, staff, and the wider community can trust that TGS operates with integrity, that funds are managed responsibly, and that its leadership remains accountable to the collective it serves."

        "title": "Guarantee long-term continuity",
        "content": "Schools that depend on individual owners or private investors often change direction when those individuals move on. As a community-owned, non-profit institution, The Garzón School is protected from that risk. The Asociación Civil structure ensures that the school's philosophy, resources, and leadership transition smoothly across generations, maintaining continuity in purpose and identity while allowing for growth and evolution over time."
      },
      "participation": {
        "title": "Foster community participation",
        "content": "Perhaps the greatest strength of the Asociación Civil model is that it invites every parent and guardian to play an active role in shaping the school's future. Membership is open, participation is encouraged, and dialogue is constant. Families are not merely clients — they are co-builders of an educational project grounded in shared values and collective trust. This sense of ownership and belonging is what gives The Garzón School its unique energy and resilience."

      "impact": {
        "title": "Ensure social impact and inclusion",
        "content": "The Asociación Civil model enables The Garzón School to direct resources toward meaningful community impact rather than private profit, supporting our long-term goal of becoming a needs-blind institution where access depends on a student's potential, not a family's finances. By reinvesting surplus funds and mobilizing community support, the school sustains scholarships, outreach initiatives, and partnerships that open doors for talented children from all backgrounds. In this way, governance and social mission work hand in hand: every structural choice reinforces our belief that education should be a force for inclusion, fairness, and opportunity."
